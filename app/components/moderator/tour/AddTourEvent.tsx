/*
NOTES:
 - Will start by giving the option of what kind of event with a dropdown (restaurant, site, hotel, other)
 - Next: give dropdown
 - add timestamps
    - check for conflicts with existing events
    - nice to have: have google maps calculte the distance between the 2 events to help operations understand plausability
 - option to change default text
